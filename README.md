## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- A Unix operating system (MacOS, Linux)
- gcc or another C compiler
- make
- The miniLibX library
- The libft library is required and can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/LeSabreDeDieu/libft).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine :

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LeSabreDeDieu/Cub3D.git
cd Cub3D
```
2. Then compile the project using make :

```sh
make
```

## Usage

To launch the game, run the generated binary :

```sh
./cub3D [path_to_map_file]
```

Ensure that you provide a valid map file as an argument. Map files must adhere to the specific format "file.ber" to be correctly interpreted by the game.

## Features

- Real-time movement in a 3D environment
- Collision with walls
- Texture rendering on walls
